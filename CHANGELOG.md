# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- 🚀 Feat: Add new code translations for C#, C++ and C. This is a merge
  from the original project located at
  https://gitlab.com/ddi-tu-dresden/cs-school-tools/struktog.

## 1.2.1

- 🐛 Fix: Exported PNG does not include borders on first try. We used a
  hacky workaround, which might fail in same cases, but should work most
  of the time. If it does not work for you, you need to try downloading
  the PNG again.

## 1.2.0

- 🚀 Feat: Synchronize current state with the URL parameters. This allows
  for copying and pasting just the URL to share a diagram.
